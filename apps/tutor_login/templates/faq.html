                    <h4>How This Works</h4>

                    <p>If you're reading this, you've successfully managed to log in. Well done! First things to
                        know:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li> You can view the amount owed to you for lessons tutored by clicking on the "pupil/credits"
                            tab.
                        </li>
                        <li> You can view the amount of lessons each of your pupils have by clicking on the
                            "pupil/credits" tab.
                        </li>
                        <li> Progress reports are to be filled out after every lesson. HOMEWORK IS ALWAYS TO BE GIVEN.
                            These reports get emailed to the parent/guardian of the pupil, or to the pupil themselves.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            We work on an honesty system where we do not expect to receive confirmation
                            from the pupil that the lesson has actually been taught. Fill out the progress report at the
                            lesson. You can login on your phone through your browser.
                        </li>
                    </ol>

                    <h4>What is expected of me as a tutor?</h4>

                    <p>To be honest, not much other than the basics.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Know your work 100%. If there is work you don't know in a lesson, reconsider registering a
                            progress report.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Be on time.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            ALWAYS set homework. This is a strong requirement. Pupils do not improve without homework.
                        </li>
                    </ol>

                    <h4>FAQ</h4>

                    <h5> How much am I paid? </h5>

                    <p> {{ high_school }} and {{ uni }}.</p>

                    <h5> When do I get paid?</h5>

                    <p>You will get paid between the 25th and the end of the month for that month. It takes 24 hours for
                        lessons to be processed on our end.</p>

                    <h5> How will I be notified of pupils in my area?</h5>

                    <p> You will receive an sms detailing available. Respond with the code in the sms to opt to tutor
                        that pupil. All correspondence is done via email thereafter.</p>

                    <h5>I've just registered a lesson, why can't I register another immediately?</h5>

                    <p>Security reasons. It stops Malice (anyone malicious) from tampering with your progress
                    reports and registering lessons as they see fit.</p>

                    <h5> Some tutoring advice</h5>
                    <ol>
                        <li> Always set homework! This isn't so much advice as it is a requirement.
                            Always check that homework is completed. The progress report will ask for this.
                        </li>
                        <li> Always stick to the syllabus and follow the teachers' methods. Do not teach a different
                            method unless absolutely necessary.
                        </li>
                        <li> Repetition is key! Be prepared to explain things more than once, and be sceptical if the
                            student tells you he/she understands the first time. Sometimes they are too polite or
                            intimidated for their own good.
                        </li>
                        <li>Make sure the student can do the homework by getting him/her to do similar questions under
                            your supervision. Get the student to do as much by him/herself as possible.
                        </li>
