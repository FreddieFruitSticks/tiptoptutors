                    <p><strong>Tip Top Tutors</strong> was founded due to an ever-increasing need for tuition in mathematical-based subjects. We are specialised in these subjects and as such our tutors know exactly how to increase the pupil's marks.</p>
                    <p> At Tip Top Tutors we aim to guarantee good results and therefore hand-pick only the very best and brightest tutors. Each tutor has a complete background check before they are allowed to tutor, and each pupil tutored by Tip Top Tutors is closely monitored to ensure that their needs are met. </p>

                        <p>If you purchase a product from a store, every now and then you will get a 'bad apple'. The
                            only thing to do is return this product. Unfortunately, we cannot have the private lessons
                            that were tutored returned (since you cannot return the tutorâ€™s time like you can a tangible
                            product), but we can offer to tutor the pupil for free to ensure their marks do actually
                            improve. That is why we are prepared to offer the pupil an extra 3 months of tutoring
                            absolutely free if his/her marks do not increase when using our tutors. This is our quality
                            assurance guarantee.

                       <p>Private tuition is a method of education that has, in our experience, proven to improve grades better than any other method of extra-curricular activity. It gives pupils the opportunity to discuss their particular difficulties, allows the tutor to teach in the exact way that allows each different pupil to learn best, and the pupil is compelled to engage with the tutor without any distractions.</p>
                       <p>Our systems of tuition are all geared towards mathematical-based subjects and our tutors are all mathematically-inclined, and numerically-talented, individuals. We monitor each pupil on a weekly basis and encourage tutors to take a mentor-like approach when tutoring the pupil. This way our pupils want to learn, which is a stack-load better than forced learning (trust us!).</p>
