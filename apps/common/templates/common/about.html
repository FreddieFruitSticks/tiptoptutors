                        <p><strong>Tip Top Tutors</strong> was founded by a team of graduates from the University of
                            Cape Town.
                            We found that there was an increasing need for tutoring in mathematical-based subjects.
                            We are specialised in these subjects and, as such, our tutors know exactly how to guide you,
                            and how to help you achieve your goals.</p>

                        <p>We believe that a tutoring agency should be more
                            than just a ‘middle-man’. That is why <strong>Tip Top Tutors</strong> guarantees an
                            improvement in
                            grades. Each tutor has a complete background check, and each pupil is closely monitored to
                            ensure
                            their needs are met.</p>

                            <p>If you purchase a product from a store, every now and then you will get a 'bad apple'.
                                The
                                only thing to do is return this product. Unfortunately, we cannot have the private
                                lessons
                                that were tutored returned (since you cannot return the tutor’s time like you can a
                                tangible
                                product), but we can offer to tutor the pupil for free to ensure their marks do actually
                                improve. That is why we are prepared to offer the pupil an extra 2 months of tutoring
                                absolutely free if his/her marks do not increase when using our tutors. This is our
                                quality
                                assurance guarantee.

                            <p>Private tuition is a method of education that has, in our experience, proven to improve
                                grades better than any other method of extra-curricular activity. It gives pupils the
                                opportunity to discuss their particular difficulties, allows the tutor to teach in the
                                exact way that allows each different pupil to learn best, and the pupil is compelled to
                                engage with the tutor without any distractions.</p>

                            <p>Our systems of tuition are all geared towards mathematical-based subjects and our tutors
                                are all mathematically-inclined, and numerically-talented, individuals. We monitor each
                                pupil on a weekly basis and encourage tutors to take a mentor-like approach when
                                tutoring the pupil. This way our pupils want to learn, which is a stack-load better than
                                forced learning (trust us!).</p>
